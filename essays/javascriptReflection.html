<h2 id="what-i-think-of-javascript-so-far">What I think of Javascript so far</h2>

<p>I have worked with Javascript previously in high school, but it has been quite some time since I coded an application using Javascript. Relearning the code using FreeCodeCamp was a great refresher. Javascript contains all the basic value types and fundamentals found in any other programming language. It also connects and manipulates HTML and CSS.</p>

<p>Javascript compared to Java is much more simplified. The main difference between the two is that Javascript doesn’t require you to mention data types when creating variables, or parameters. This speeds up the coding process quite a bit, and allows for more flexibility when manipulating the code. This in turn could cause more problems due to the missing safety net in Javascript. Java was very descriptive when it came to code failures and required the Software engineer to create code that combated the possible errors that could occur from the code using try catches and specifying data types. Javascript however, doesn’t have this data type safety net, so we still have to create try catches, but small mistakes such as passing in the wrong data type can cause major malfunctions in large pieces of code.</p>

<h2 id="is-javascript-a-good-language">Is Javascript a good language?</h2>

<p>This doesn’t stop Javascript from being a bad language from a software engineering perspective. It is not a very rigorous language and can even be used to code both the front and back end of a website. Javascript is simple and easy to learn, and is one of the most popular programming languages. Sadly does not mean Javascript is a perfect language, Javascript also faces problems with browser support, so certain browsers will interpret Javascript differently from other browsers. Even with this caveat Javascript is still widely used because every browser, although interpreting it differently, still supports the code. So Javascript, as I see it, is a good software engineering language.</p>

<h2 id="atheletic-software-engineering-and-wods">Atheletic software engineering and WODs!</h2>

<p>I found athletic software engineering fun and useful. The WODs are like algorithm problems, where we have to use our knowledge of Javascript to solve simple coding problems. I think this style of learning is hands-on because we have to code the solutions ourselves. The WODs are also not stressful. I do not believe they should be stressful as they are just fun challenges to prepare us for the actual test. Athletic software engineering is a strong in its use because what certain programming classes lack are these classroom interactions and brain scratchers. Many classes in college often have professors ramble and speak to you instead of you interacting with the class itself. It makes a lot of people lose interest in the material they learn, but when we are forced to code and solve problems it keeps us engaged with the class, which is why athletic software engineering is a strong tool.</p>
