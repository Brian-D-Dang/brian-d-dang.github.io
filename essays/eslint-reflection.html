<h2 id="a-general-idea-of-eslint">A general idea of ESlint</h2>
<p>Coding and programming is fascinating. It sets a clear boundary and rules on what you can and cannot do in each language, but coding provides enough freedom for you to create whatever you please. ESlint then comes into the picture and slaps you in the face screaming “everything you’re doing is wrong and it’s okay” and corrects all your mistakes like a tiger mom hovering over you watching your every move.</p>

<p>ESlint provides corrections to your code based on certain rules that the user sets. It makes it so your code meets coding standards and provides less possible mistakes. ESlint will also stop your code from functioning, if a certain coding rule set in ESlint is broken. This is so you’re forced to correct your mistakes.</p>

<h2 id="spicy-hot-take">SPICY HOT TAKE</h2>
<p>I like having ESlint and these coding standards, but some rules can be really annoying. Coding standards and rules may differ from company to company. What this means is that although you agree with certain rules, other rules may just be a slight hindrance/annoyance.</p>

<p>Using the ESlint in class was useful to me, but certain rules peeved me because to me it just doesn’t make sense. An example was a rule where you cannot have a variable name and parameter name be the same name. This is an inconvenience because when working on WODs in class we create these functions that only have one purpose which is taking in the variable name, and since we can’t make it the same we have to create a random name or name it something similar. So although I do find it interesting I do believe that I won’t ever agree to every “Coding standard” a eslint file will have.</p>

<h2 id="why-coding-standards-are-important">Why coding standards are important</h2>
<p>Coding standards are important in large scale projects because it helps mitigate spaghetti code. Which isn’t entirely true, a coding standard wouldn’t stop anyone from coding terribly, I would say it’s comparable to spraying a nice bit of poo-pourri after someone drops a massive turd in your toilet at home.</p>

<p>However it definitely helps when a strong team of coders come together on a project because although each individual is capable of coding large scale projects, each of them may have different coding standards. Regulating to a set standard helps with mitigating any variation throughout the code and makes it consistent to the team working on said project.</p>
