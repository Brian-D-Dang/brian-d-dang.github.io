## What is the project

The project was to implement Google Contact Center AI (CCAI) into Hawaii’s Department of Human Services (DHS). This is so clients are able to get information on SNAP, CCPs, TANF, MQD, etc. The program will offer assistance and allow the client to access their accounts and the program will be able to point them to more info, or connect them to a DHS worker. 

During development Google CCAI offered a tool known as DialogFlow ES. This tool allowed us to create specific “Agents” which acted as the AI worker. Each “Agent” was trained to understand different languages. What made CCAI so incredible was how it remembered certain topics that the client had spoken about during the call. This allows the AI to jump to different topic points based on previous context. This gives the “Agent” it’s AI capabilities.

## What I found challenging 
The project offered a lot of new obstacles. When creating contexts and situations for the “Agent” we had to make sure it contained all the correct contexts beforehand, and included specific key words that would trigger the “Agent” conversation. Combined with a new project structure for CCAI, which was similar to springBoot project structuring, made the work much more intimidating. But as I took the time to learn CCAI and familiarize myself with Java I began picking up speed on different tasks as I learned the different quirks to the application.
